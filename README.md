# About my first project on GitHub
This project involves analyzing sales data to uncover insights into customer purchasing patterns, product performance, and revenue trends. Using Excel, I performed data cleaning, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), and created interactive dashboards to present key insights that help drive business decisions.
